### From Author
A functionally unopinionated but aesthetically distinctive document class, especially well-suited to homework assignments on mathematics and computer science. Using different fonts, your work has a fresh but professional look. The class provides many useful macros, making it easy to produce beautifully typeset documents.

A [template](main.tex) ([pdf](main.pdf)) is provided, containing some examples. It's also available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/gijss-homework-template/xrhhfgqcfbft) (although often outdated).

### Editors Note
This is document class is excellent for providing a styllistic look for most homework assignments. I slightly modified this document class with the help of Muhammad Asavir to also include auto base-number conversions. The sample document for this is provided in NYU_Homework_Format.pdf, though I strongly suggest getting used to using, creating, and modifing LaTex documents on your own.
