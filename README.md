# homeworg.cls

A template for homework assignments, especially suitable for mathematics and computer science. Using a different font, your homework assignments have a distinct look. The class provides many useful macros, making it easy to produce beautifully typeset documents.

A [template](main.tex) ([pdf](main.pdf)) is provided, containing some examples. It can also be found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/gijss-homework-template/xrhhfgqcfbft).
